I work on the frontier of theoretical particle physics and cosmology.
I'm in particular interested in the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry, with emphasizing on the models related with electroweak (-like) phase transition.
Models that can be compatible with solutions to other problems in particle physics will always catch my eyes.


Computational uncertainties and interesting dynamics, phase structures are also super-interesting to me, and will be one of the most important works that I plan to do in recent future.


I also work on some other particle cosmology topics such as dark matter, or some experimental/cosmological probes for interesting physics, including LHC physics, beam-dump experiments, and other cosmological signals.
