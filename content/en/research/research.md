My work lies at the intersection of theoretical particle physics and cosmology, with a special focous on the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry.
In particular, I pay attention to models associated with electroweak (-like) phase transitions.
Models that can be compatible with solutions to other problems in particle physics will catch my eyes.
Specifically, I care about the strong CP problem, dark matter candidate, and naturalness on various topics.
Following this sake, the computational uncertainties in the electroweak phase transtion and baryogenesis, including the effective potential, wall velocity, and gravitational waves, are appealing topics for me.
Sometimes interesting models or mechanisms may strongly motivate me to work on phenomenology probes, such as gravitational wave signals from phase transitions, uncovered collider signals, dark matter probes on various experiments, and so forth.

More specifically, I'm focusing on the following topics in the recent days. Any discussion about these topics are welcome. This includes:
- New models for electroweak baryogenesis that is different from traditional scalar extensions.
- Wall velocity computation in electroweak-like phase transitions.
- Gravitational wave calculation and understanding in electroweak-like phase transitions.
- Any interesting imprints of axion rotations.
- Possible realization of axiogenesis.
- Building up of the parity-symmetric model to solve various problems.


# Projects

Here is a list of the projects that I've worked on. The introduction of each projects are really introductory and only assumes the reader have the basic knowledge of quantum field theory or even less.
If you are an expert and want to have a quick understanding of what I'm working on, skip the introduction section.
