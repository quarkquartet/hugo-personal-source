title: Electroweak (-like) baryogenesis
summary: Electroweak (-like) phase transition is expected to happen in the early universe, given the well-known spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking. This phase transition, if of first order, can provide the necessary out-of-equilbrium condition for baryogenesis. Such a phase transition can happen for the SM electroweak symmetry breaking, or any other similar symmetry breaking in BSM gauge group extensions. This project investigates possibilities to achieve electroweak (-like) baryogenesis in different models.
