You can find my contact information here.

I encourage you to contact me via the work email if you would like to talk about physics. Otherwise, you can send me email to my personal email address, or contact me on Twitter.

Contacting me via instant chat app is also possible (and actually preferred after we get familiar with each other), but a first contact via the above methods is needed.
After that, you can reach me out on skype for academic chatting and on Telegram for all the other stuffs.
WeChat will not be available unless you are currently located at Chinese mainland.

Facebook may also be used for some irregular contacts, but I don't put many moments there.
