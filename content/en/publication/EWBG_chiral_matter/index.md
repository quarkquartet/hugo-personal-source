abstract:  We propose a framework where a phase transition associated with a gauge symmetry breaking that
  occurs (not far) above the electroweak scale sets a stage for baryogenesis
  similar to the electroweak baryogenesis in the Standard Model.
  A concrete realization utilizes the breaking of $SU(2)_R \times U(1)_X \rightarrow U(1)_Y$.
  New chiral fermions charged under the extended gauge symmetry have nonzero lepton numbers,
  which makes the $B-L$ symmetry anomalous.
  The new lepton sector contains a large flavor-dependent CP violation, similar to the
  Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa phase, without inducing sizable electric dipole moments of the Standard Model particles.
  A bubble wall dynamics associated with the first-order phase transition and $SU(2)_R$ sphaleron processes
  generate a lepton asymmetry, which is transferred into a baryon asymmetry via the ordinary electroweak sphaleron process.
  Unlike the Standard Model electroweak baryogenesis, the new phase transition can be of the strong first order
  and the new CP violation is not significantly suppressed by Yukawa couplings,
  so that the observed asymmetry can be produced. 
  The model can be probed by collider searches for new particles and the observation of gravitational waves.
  One of the new leptons becomes a dark matter candidate.
  The model can be also embedded into a left-right symmetric theory to solve the strong CP problem.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: It has been known the electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG) in the minimal SM is suppressed by the large damping rate of the quark quasiparticle in the thermal plasma, due to the strong QCD interaction. Old literatures proposed a possibility that lepton scattering may be capable of generating enough baryon asymmetry since the damping rate could be much smaller. Is this really the case? This paper proposes a model that mimic the SM quark sector with chiral leptons. We investigate the thermodynamics in detail and concluded that it could be only marginally OK to generate the baryon asymmetry from a lepton sector with CKM-like structure.
