abstract: The upcoming MUonE experiment aims to precisely measure the running of the fine structure constant via elastic muon-electron scattering, to shed light on the current tension in the muon's anomalous magnetic moment. In addition to its primary function as a precision experiment, MUonE also offers a unique testing ground to probe long-lived vector bosons. Such vector bosons can be produced via $\mu e \to \mu e V$ or $\mu N \to \mu N V$ scattering and decay into an electron/positron pair a few centimeters away from the interaction point. With its high-resolution tracking system and unique geometric design, MUonE is wellsuited to reconstruct displaced vertices close to the target, allowing it to probe parameter space previously unattainable at colliders and longer-baseline beam dump experiments. We present a comprehensive study of the discovery potential of BSM vector boson mediators at the MUonE experiment. We show that MUonE can fill the long-standing gap in the parameter space of vector boson mediators with masses up to around 100 MeV.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We show that MUonE can also discover thermal relic dark matter using only its nominal experimental setup. Furthermore, our results show that the downstream ECAL plays a key role in rejecting backgrounds for this search, thereby providing strong motivation for the MUonE to keep this component in the final experimental design.
