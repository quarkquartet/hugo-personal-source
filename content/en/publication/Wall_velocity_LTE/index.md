abstract: "A precise determination of the bubble wall velocity $v_w$ is crucial for making accurate predictions of the baryon asymmetry and gravitational wave (GW) signals in models of electroweak baryogenesis (EWBG). Working in the local thermal equilibrium approximation, we exploit entropy conservation to present efficient algorithms for computing $v_w$, significantly streamlining the calculation. We then explore the parameter dependencies of $v_w$, focusing on two sample models capable of enabling a strong first-order electroweak phase transition: a $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric singlet extension of the SM, and a model for baryogenesis with CP violation in the dark sector. We study correlations among $v_w$ and the two common measures of phase transition strength, $\\alpha_n$ and $v_n/T_n$. Interestingly, we find a relatively model-insensitive relationship between $v_n/T_n$ and $\\alpha_n$. We also observe an upper bound on $\\alpha_n$ for the deflagration/hybrid wall profiles naturally compatible with EWBG, the exact value for which varies between models, significantly impacting the strength of the GW signals. In summary, our work provides a framework for exploring the feasibility of EWBG models in light of future GW signals."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We clarify the most efficient way of calculating bubble wall velocities, with a systematic way of implementing the entropy conservation approach with the general equation of state. We numerically confirm the local thermal equilibrium approximation and investigate the parameter dependencies of it. We comment on the impact on the baryogenesis and gravitational waves.
