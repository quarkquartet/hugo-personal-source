## Introduction

Parity is a good solution to the strong CP problem. I have written a [post for strong CP problem and its solutions]({{< relref "../../post/strongCP/index.md#a-description-for-the-strong-cp-problem">}}).
Basically, we can have a gauge group of the standard parity-symmetric model {{< math >}}$SU(3)_C \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_{B-L}${{< /math >}}. The next step is: **can this model provide us more solutions to other unsolved puzzles**?

Recently, I've been working in this direction. Things included are: dark matter, baryogenesis, and neutrino masses.
