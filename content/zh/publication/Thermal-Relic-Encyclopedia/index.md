abstract: Thermal freeze-out is a compelling framework for naturally generating the dark matter abundance. We systematically study a broad range of dark matter and mediator particle combinations that can viably realize thermal freeze-out, focusing on models in which the mediator couples to Standard Model quarks. In each case, we calculate the relic density and consider existing constraints from accelerators, cosmology, direct detection, and indirect detection over the full range of dark matter and mediator masses. We present an encyclopedic catalog of matrix elements, cross sections, and decay rates which can be used as a reference for future studies of dark matter phenomenology.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: We show that MUonE can also discover thermal relic dark matter using only its nominal experimental setup. Furthermore, our results show that the downstream ECAL plays a key role in rejecting backgrounds for this search, thereby providing strong motivation for the MUonE to keep this component in the final experimental design.
