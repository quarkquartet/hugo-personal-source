abstract: "We consider weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP) dark matter in a Parity solution to the strong CP problem. The WIMP phenomenology can be drastically affected by the presence of Parity partners of the WIMP and electroweak gauge bosons. We focus on a Parity extension of $SU(2)_L$-doublet fermion dark matter, identify the viable parameter space, and derive the predictions of the theory. We find that the Parity symmetry breaking scale is bounded from above, with the bound given by $25-60$ $\\rm TeV$, depending on whether or not dark matter and its Parity partner coannihilate with each other.
The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider, future colliders, and direct and indirect detection experiments can probe the parameter space further, with correlated signal rates."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: Parity-symmetric theory introduces more interactions in addition to the traditional electroweak doublet WIMP dark matter. These new interactions open new windows for this type of WIMP. The successful production of dark matter relic abundance predicts an upper bound on the Parity breaking scale, which was absent in the past.
