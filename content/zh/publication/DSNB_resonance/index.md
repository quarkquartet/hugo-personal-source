abstract: Neutrino self-interactions beyond the standard model have profound implications in astrophysics and cosmology. In this work, we study an uncharted scenario in which one of the three neutrino species has a mass much smaller than the temperature of the cosmic neutrino background. This results in a relativistic component that significantly broadens the absorption feature on the astrophysical neutrino spectra, in contrast to the sharply peaked absorption expected in the extensively studied scenarios assuming a fully nonrelativistic cosmic neutrino background. By solving the Boltzmann equations for neutrino absorption and regeneration, we demonstrate that this mechanism provides novel sensitivity to sub-keV mediator masses, well below the traditional $\sim 1$--100 MeV range. Future observations of the diffuse supernova neutrino background with Hyper-Kamiokande could probe coupling strengths down to $g \sim 10^{-8}$, surpassing existing constraints by orders of magnitude. These findings open new directions for discoveries and offer crucial insights into the interplay between neutrinos and the dark sector.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
# summary: With one neutrino flavor still being relativistic today, the resonance of the scattering between incoming DSNB neutrino and cosmic neutrino background can be significantly widened. The distortion of the DSNB spectrum can thus be used to probe a much wider parameter space of neutrino self-interaction. We show that a mediator at eV scale can be probed with the coupling to neutrino as low as $10^{-8}$.
