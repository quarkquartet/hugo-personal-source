title: Neutrino mass and self-interaction
summary: Neutrino is a massless, feebly-interacting particle in SM. However, it is known that neutrino should be massive. New physics is guaranteed to exist in the neutrino sector. Basic question naturally raises regarding neutrino physics. What is the source of neutrino mass? Can neutrino have self-interactions?
