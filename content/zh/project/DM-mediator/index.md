Dark matter has been an enduring mystery for decades. For now, people tends to be interested in dark sectors that talk with Standard Model particles only via a "portal". This portal is usually a mediator that can interact both with dark sector particles and the SM particles.

Such a kind of mediators have rich implications on cosmology and experiments, and has been intensitvely studied in the past years. On the one hand, various experiments have been proposed, designed, and run. On the other hand, various cosmological imprints can be left from the evolution of dark matter and dark mediator in the early universe.

I work on both side of the "mediator". You can see my publications below.
