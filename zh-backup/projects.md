        我关注粒子物理和宇宙学理论的前沿。主要关注的问题包括正反物质不对称、宇宙学相变、暗物质起源等等。
        同时，我也关注一些实验与观测上的信号，包括对撞机实验、各种beam-dump experiment，以及一些宇宙学观测。

        我最关注的问题是正反物质不对称问题（baryogenesis problem/matter-antimatter asymmetry）。我的研究主要集中在采用电弱相变相关（electroweak phase transition）的模型来解释这些不对称的起源。我关注这方面的新模型，同时也关注相关的计算细节。

I work on the frontier of theoretical particle physics and cosmology. I'm in particular interested in the origin of matter-antimatter asymmetry, with emphasizing on the models related with electroweak (-like) phase transition.
I also work on some other particle cosmology topics such as dark matter, or some experimental/cosmological probes for interesting physics.

Below you can find introduction of the physics topics that I'm interested in. I'll introduce them in plain language. If you are professional and want to see more, you can go to [the bottom of this page](#projects), where you can find the interesting projects that I've worked on.


## Baryogenesis problem: where are the anti-matters?

It's a common sense that we can only see matters, not anti-matters, in our daily life.

In a more scientific description, we say that the matter is over-dominating the anti-matter in number density (or energy density, whatever you want to call) in our universe.

The problem is: the matter and anti-matter should always be equivalently created since the Big Bang, unless there are some asymmetries during some time periods that make them produced differently. So what are those asymmetries, and when did they happen?
